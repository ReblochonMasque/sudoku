=========================================
Implementation of a sudoku puzzle solver:
=========================================

- uses a mix of strategies with constraint propagation and search with backtracking.
- inspired from Peter Norvig's early article: `Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle <http://norvig.com/sudoku.html>`_
- related to Udacity [Software Testing `Course <https://www.udacity.com/wiki/cs258>`_

======================
Learning Goals are to:
======================

- TDD
- Architecture/design of project
- Use of Git
- Continuous integration with Travis for tests, coverage and code quality
- Use of Mocks in unit tests

=======
Future:
=======

- Implement a random tester (fuzzer)
- Generate hard to solve puzzles
- implement more strategies
- GUI as seen `here <http://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm>`_
